# DETECTION-OF-SPAM-AND-FAKE-SPAM-MESSAGES-IN-TWITTER
We propose a deep neural network framework for detecting spam and fake spam messages on Twitter. Utilizing word embeddings, LSTM/GRU, and CNN layers, our model captures the sequential and local features of tweets. Trained on a labeled dataset, it distinguishes between legitimate, spam, and fake spam tweets with high accuracy.
